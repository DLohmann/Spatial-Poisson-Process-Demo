# Spatial-Poisson-Process-Demo

Spatial Poisson Process visual for this wikipedia article:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_point_process

## Demo 1:
Draw random unit squares (area = 1), in a region with area A. Then draw N random points all at once. Keep track if how many points land in the unit square. Do this many times. Then plot how many times 0 points landed in square, 1 point landed inside, 2 points, etc. Then plot against Poisson distribution. 

## Demo 2:
Same thing, but draw the points first, and then randomly place the square.
